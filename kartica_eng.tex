Abstract:
\par
This paper examines system response to harmonic excitation, first discussing the
single degree of freedom (sdof) system response, followed by analyzing the multiple
degree of freedom (mdof) system response. It discusses response characteristics,
frequency response functions, as well as the concept of resonance, and analyzes the
theory's experimental application. The mdof system analysis starts with a discussion
on the steady state response, for which modal analysis is not necessary, and
continues with the application of the modal analysis.
